Tyler Amato,"As I was messaging on a friend's story, suddenly the app itself closed on me. And when I went to go re-open the app, the initial yellow loading screen that appears for a second after clicking the app, opens and closes immediately. I tried completely closing the app as well as resetting my phone, and the same problem still occurs. Also, I have the most recent version. And no new updates. Still can't identify the issue.",2.0,2024-12-10T07:31:59Z
Jake Zollin,"This app peaked around 2016-2018. Today it is a shell of what it used to be. The voice call quality is awful no matter how new or old your device is. The app can't send a video in full unless I sit there and watch it send. I have the app set to still run in the background, so it's not a setting on my phone I need to change. It's just that incompetent. The ads on here are awful too. All of the content this app offers is total slop. Specifically the Discovery page. Overexaggerated click bait slop!",1.0,2024-12-31T16:32:31Z
Kyle Brooks,"The app does what it has always done and does it well. A lot has changed since it came out. However, the discover stuff that appears underneath your friends' stories becomes more and more insufferable every day. From pseudoscientific videos to outright softcore po**, I get their ""creators"" have to appeal to the lowest denominator, but a sizeable majority of them are borderline braindead. I don't want to see this garbage. The algorithm then refuses to follow your suggestions.",2.0,2024-12-25T15:30:00Z
Quentin Harris,"I enjoy the app, and use it to text several people that I know of including my wife and kid. My only issue is that whenever I click on something whether it be the transcript for a voice note, or just something completely random like a specific chat with a person, every now and again it'll just open up some random link and won't let me click on whatever it is I'm trying to click on. This needs to get fixed, it is infuriating. I'll rate five stars if it gets fixed but for now it's seriously bad",3.0,2024-12-27T18:39:42Z
Tom Burton,"Becoming ridden with ads, ai, and people I have no interest in seeing. App has started forcing stories from people I don't know into the mix with friends stories. I keep getting notifications about people I've never heard of posting. In addition regular when I try to put text on a snap it puts it below where my screen can show, and there's no way to fix it aside from taking a whole new picture and trying with different text. Awful, awful, user experience lately.",1.0,2024-12-30T19:58:27Z
·¥Ä ú·¥è è…™·¥õs·¥õ·¥á·¥Ö,"Delayed notifications (sometimes by hours), chats not opening when clicked, and chat screens showing up blank refusing to load messages. These are just a few problems among many with Snapchat lately. This app has steadily gone down hill as it seems to come out with new bugs more than new features. If someone sends me a snap sometimes it will buffer indefinitely until I close out and open the chats (80% of the time I'll click on the chats they won't open and if they do the screen is blank). 2/10.",2.0,2024-12-26T12:38:39Z
Garrett Randall,"Used to be a great app but lately it's gone downhill, half of it is just ads along with constant annoying attempts to get you to buy snapchat premium. Some settings seemingly just don't work, for instance, notifications and the block option. I've turned off story notifications and still got them, so I turned off notifications completely. I've tried to block accounts that I don't want snap stories from, but they still show up every time I refresh it. I've reported both issues with no response.",1.0,2024-12-30T09:07:53Z
Joshua Loper,"great app. easy, simple, rewarding, honest, accessible, to the point, fair for users, no pressure just a better experience for a phone. now I just need more friends! :) üòâ recommended even without a lot of friends. good for young audience that just want to see results from a phone. enter: the non phone Snapchat! just kidding.",5.0,2024-12-19T19:25:47Z
Aliza Weremblewski,"Ever since the last update, ads have been glitching and playing while I am watching content. It completely takes over the audio of the video I'm currently watching and plays in the background before the ad even starts. Sometimes, the audio for the ad will continue to play even after the ad is over completely ruining the experience of the app.",2.0,2024-12-14T21:40:30Z
Matt B,"Update : they now send audible ad notifications to you you can't turn off without disabling all notifications from the app. I'm uninstalling this trash. Buggy, crashes constantly, blocks users with rooted phones from using it for no good reason. The developers spend more time adding useless fluff to the app instead of trying to make this turd of an app stable.",1.0,2024-12-30T22:57:39Z
E,"Steady decline I just updated to the latest version hoping it would correct the ads playing over snaps but it doesnt, even when the app is in the background the audio continues. As far as privacy, why are you showing me random photos from my phones camera roll. This feature should only be limited to snap memories. The number of ads that play between the reels is insane. I would much rather just see a 30 sec add then get to see the reel that to continuously break it up into random blocks.",2.0,2024-12-18T21:25:00Z
Kobie Thomas,"Works ok for a messaging app. Constantly wants to send notifications about nothing though. unskipable commercials every other slide. And considering each slides only like 5 seconds, it's very annoying. almost all the reels in the discover part is click bate. Most are about someone being killed or an of model. And good luck getting through the whole story because theres so many friggin commercials. Most of the time i just end up going to youtube to find the story. Kinda a toxic app ngl",2.0,2024-12-24T20:47:42Z
Dan Miles,"Awesome app except for 1 feature you can't change, and makes no sense that you can't. In the memories section, it also sometimes shows random pictures/videos from your camera roll. I don't want to see my things saved on my camera roll when I'm showing friends/family memories on my snapchat. It's actually ridiculous that for an app that's been around this long, that there's no option to turn this feature off. Please fix, if so, 5 stars. And just by googling, alot of others have this issue too.",1.0,2024-12-12T13:47:36Z
James Obermiller,"500 characters is not enough for me to explain all of my issues, so this will be short: Snapchat is getting much worse. 1) The AI is stupid. I haven't accepted the terms for it, and I can't remove it from my chat page. 2) Ads on the chat page once a day is a new feature, so I guess snapchat doesn't make enough money from the ads in the story page. 3) I just now received a notification for an ad. I have notifications turned off except for the basics, but I get notifications for ads. Terrible.",1.0,2024-12-11T14:03:57Z
Brittany Waters,"Too many commercials. I can't even watch content I'm subscribed to because every 30 seconds is a repeat commercial. Update: A year later, and I feel like it got even worse. It's basically all just commercials. So annoying. I've never once paid attention to or bought anything from the Snapchat commercials. Update: To add to my review from last month...now the ad sounds will play over my friend's stories I'm watching. Ads are now added to friend's lists as well. SNAPCHAT IS ONE BIG AD!",1.0,2024-12-16T00:25:30Z
Wally,"They've pinned an AI chatbot to the top of your friends list, with no way to get rid of it or hide it, and I keep clicking on it by accident. Presumably the developers bought into the AI hype before realizing that users don't want to be ""friends"" with an algorithm, and now the only way to get people to use the product they've poured money into is to force everyone to use it. There have been other (optional!) ""new features"" I've found useless/annoying, but this is insane. I'm switching to Signal.",1.0,2024-12-23T23:57:39Z
Noah Guilmino,"Every thing was good. All of my stuff worked. But one day it stopped working. Everything stuck on the load. I don't understand why. At first I thought it was my wifi, but I did a speed check & it was at a mps of 30 so it wasn't wifi. Then I thought it was update. I updated the app but it was still stuck on load. Finally I uninstalled the app & reinstalled the app. Still stuck on load. This all happend when I got added to a school gc of only 40 people. Snap chat please fix this.",1.0,2024-12-18T01:41:41Z
Levi German,The amount of ad's anymore is just ridiculous. The ad's are annoying and does not make me want the product they are advertising (I don't even watch the ads). The A.I. bot is annoying to constantly have at the top. No desire to use. There's not even good filters anymore. It's just dumbass games that aren't even fun. üëéüëéüëéüëé. About to just delete because of all this. Especially the ad's,1.0,2024-12-15T04:53:52Z
Jasmine Ali,"Issue with Ads Sound on Snapchat It's been three months now, and I'm still experiencing the same issue with the app. Every time I open a Snap to watch, the sound from ads suddenly pops up and overlaps with the Snap. Because of this, I can't hear anything from the Snap I'm watching. This happens with any Snap I try to view, and it‚Äôs frustrating that it hasn‚Äôt been resolved yet.",3.0,2024-12-23T16:28:23Z
Samantha Luna,"Please consider the following: -the option to rearrange filters at the bottom of screen. There's nothing more irritating when you accidentally open a filter that's obnoxious and loud, let alone when it's one I'll NEVER use. -the option to remove auto enhance on snaps. My snaps look better before actually taking a selfie! -the option to remove the AI chat -the option to remove the stories page if we don't want to see random stories that are not friends or subscriptions Sincerely, All of us.",5.0,2024-12-24T19:51:32Z
