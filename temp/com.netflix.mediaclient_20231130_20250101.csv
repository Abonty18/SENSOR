Mujtaba Mujeeb,"When watching the display gets obnoxiously bright. Sliding the left brightness bar all the way to low doesn't help either. It's still very bright. It absolutely ruins the experience when watching in dark rooms. I purposely don't watch at night. Netflix, please fix this this is a deal breaker. Tltr: even with the dimmest settings and slider bar all the way low, the content still displays bright. Such issues are not on iPhone. Only on my android pixel 9 pro xl. Netflix please fix this.",1.0,2024-12-30T22:08:05Z
Lymbo at dawn (chicken_quesadilla),What can I say it's a pretty decent app. There aren't too many kinks although sometimes it signs me out for no apparent reason which is kind of weird. Do you want annoying issue is is that sometimes it adds films but then takes them away about a month or two later which is kind of annoying. There are some things that I were was watching and then they just disappeared the next day. I'm glad they give you a warning before they take them away. It's very easy app to navigate and I would recommend.,4.0,2024-12-26T23:13:54Z
Mason Deterding,Netflix is excellent. The app works amazing and the content on here is actually pretty good. I like it better than alot of the other services because they allow downloads with add supported plans as where others don't. I also really like that Netflix shows you what others are watching which is really helpful as well as suggesting new movies when you hit the like button.,5.0,2024-12-31T04:16:12Z
Some Person,"I'm just gonna be real honest here. I can't find anything to watch on this platform. There are like 5 shows I watch on Paramount. Everthing I watch on Netflix you've cancelled, is in limbo, or won't have episodes for months. And I can't remember the last time there was a movie that I wanted to watch on this platform. I'm really struggling to justify this subscription. You need to stop running out of new quality content.",1.0,2024-12-31T14:51:04Z
Haylee Lopez,"Netflix is a good movie streaming service. I wish they wouldn't take out good shows that get many views though. I was very interested in The Vampire Diaries and Jane The Virgin , but they both got taken off for no reason. No ads are great! And I like that they added games to the app. Very creative. Interactive shows are the best Good app, but when you get a lot of views and subscriptions from certain shows.. don't take them off. I'm spending most of my time and money on MAX and Peacock.",4.0,2024-12-27T10:52:34Z
Emma Cosco-StandingBear,"I've always loved Netflix and haven't had many issues but recently when I go in I can't watch any shows because the screen goes black and I can't play what I wanna watch but the trailers video and audio works fine. There's probably a bug and I'm sure they'll fix it and we can update the app after they fix the bug. I'll pause subscription until it works again, tho it's a minor thing I don't mind waiting I have other apps to entertain me while I wait for the issue to be solved üòÅ",5.0,2024-12-22T04:41:59Z
Earl Lemke,"Freezes my Roku and phone when I'm using Netflix. I have to power off and back on my device often when using Netflix. Very slow response. If that isn't bad enough, I get the want to share Netflix every time I turn it on. I don't want to share and I should have to click on learn more every time I log in!!! Nice selection, to bad it's not worth keeping with all the bugs.",1.0,2024-12-14T02:02:37Z
K N,"Was very disappointed when the app told me that ""this device isn't part of the Netflix Household,"" when it very well was (and still is). I had no problems prior to that screen. It forcing me to either ""watch temporarily"" or sign out was annoying, as there wasn't an option to just watch normally and fix the problem as a whole. It feels like a very unnecessary and inconvenient update.",3.0,2024-12-05T01:03:53Z
Jamie Edwards,"My subscription renewed two weeks ago and I cannot watch anything. It's just a black screen with the sound playing. Subtitles and skip recaps and ADDS and trailars will play, but NOT the actual video. As soon as the video part goes to start it's a black screen. I called them and they say it's a manufacturing issue and no one else has reported a problem - as I see otherwise in the reviews. No refund either and I have been a customer for years.",1.0,2024-12-04T00:52:10Z
Delano McFarlane,"Been a Netflix subscriber for many many many years. Very happy with the service. But the ""this device is not part of your Netflix household"" nonsense that just popped up is confusing and frustrating. I'm sitting in my home on my phone all I want to do is browse the catalog and add something to my queue... Not sharing passwords/account, not streaming to multiple devices... So why do I have to figure out which devices are registered to some newly Netflix household that I've never had to define?",3.0,2024-12-08T14:52:29Z
Sweet T,"I generally don't have problems with Netflix but this week has been a nightmare! I keep getting an error saying my ""device isn't part of the Netflix household for this acct."" I ask for a code to watch temporarily and never get it. Either thru text or email! I pay $16/month so we can stream 'ad free & up to 2 [lousy] devices' yet nothing works! For the amount we pay we should never have any issues. What is going on Netflix?! App is up to date & so is the bill.",1.0,2024-12-07T11:33:37Z
Dale Bowry,"The only downside to Netflix, besides the content not being Universal and all-encompassing is the inability to contact someone about problems with your account. Most problems have to do with the financial end of things, that being your balance being low. Still there's no way to contact someone to see what you have to do. At the very least it's not shown; no email address is given out as an link to information.",4.0,2024-12-25T17:28:42Z
Ameer Hamza,Good experience But the website is BAD! As when I try to use the desktop version (which is also browser based) it sometimes doesn't work and sometimes i keep clicking on my profile or any profile and nothing happens Also it would be good if they could give us something in exchange for the subscription we pay! There are no movies that i want to watch! And no latest ones either! Some movies are restricted to some specific regions I mean Why!!!,4.0,2024-12-07T17:32:45Z
Tyler White,"The implementation of the policy where you have to check into a Wi-Fi network every so often is awful for people who travel or spend time away from home for long periods. On top of that the selection has been dwindling for a long time, with a lot of misses as of late when it comes to their originals. You cannot travel and use your subscription at all, I can't watch Netflix at my partner's house and it's really upsetting",1.0,2024-12-23T01:15:52Z
Shenee Collins,"For some reason, the way you show your closer caption has changed. The words are all over the place and instead of them being in a straight line across the bottom ( allowing more words at a time. they're in clumps that jump everywhere cuttung off a letter or two of the last word. This makes things super distracting and hard to read. When a word is cut off, there's no dash to tell you the word has continued, causing it to look like it is misspelled. Please fix it. Thank you.",3.0,2024-12-04T05:55:26Z
Ryan Bey,"Netflix is great for Netflix Original content. I have a lot of different streaming services and Netflix overall is mid-level / average in terms of content offerings. This used to be my #1 choice and now I check it once in a while. I downgraded to the ad-based subscription and I noticed that a good portion of the catalog is locked unless I upgrade my plan. I think that is ridiculous, other platforms don't do that. Netflix went downhill a lot. The app and functionality works perfectly fine.",3.0,2024-11-27T06:14:04Z
Linda Woods,I enjoy my Netflix. The only thing I don't like is waiting for the new continuances series yet to come with a movie. But I guess it has to be. I love the fact that there's no interruptions with commercials. I haven't found another like that. There's one I do like and downloaded but eventually I had to delete it bcuz the commercial interruptions were crazy. When I sit for a movie I want to see just that. A movie! Without commercials. No matter how long the movie is. Thank you for Netflix!!!,5.0,2024-10-11T13:12:42Z
Morgan Osborn,"Definitely dropping this app. The Netflix originals are great, but this last update is the nail in the coffin. $6.99 for ad-supported content, but you can't get all content. You also can't stream to Chromecast, which is what many users without Smart TVs use. If I want the full Netflix experience, I have to upgrade to the next plan of $15.49 a month. Every app wants $15 a month. I might as well switch back to cable. No thanks!",1.0,2024-10-19T22:39:41Z
Cameron Pendleton,"Netflix used to be my favorite streaming service. They have extremely good shows and lots of good movies. But here recently, the apps keep crashing. Nothing has been loading properly. After trying to watch the fights tonight, I'm done. I'm going back to hulu. Good luck with your live streams in the future. You guys have more than enough money and have had plenty of time to get your systems ready. This is nonsense.",1.0,2024-11-16T04:26:31Z
Brian Pinzon,"I have a Chromecast and using it on prime video. The casting Icon on prime app works. Normally after I sign into Netflix's app and pick a movie to watch. The casting icon would appear in the right upper corner. In this case, I have been struggling by trying different ways as to figuring out why am I having so much trouble getting Netflix's to link up to my Chrome cast. I checked to see if there's an update. There wasn't any, I tried to reset the mobile wifi. That didn't work either.",1.0,2024-11-21T04:27:11Z
