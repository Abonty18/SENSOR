Jennifer Luke,"New update is absolute garbage. I just want to see my friends' stories, not ads and random ""discover"" stories. Put things back where they were. Keep stories and chat separate. edit 4/28/25: the app is somehow worse! Now it won't save my notification preferences and keeps spamming me with stories and updates from people I don't know or follow. it's gotten so bad I've turned off notifications all together",1.0,2025-04-28
John Walton,"Dumb app, extremely basic, annoying to use, but some people I know outright REFUSE to communicate any other way, so I'm here. My real issue is that today, I have been unable to load snaps, and several that I want to send just aren't sending. I also can't view my friends list at all. I've got a perfect wifi connection, so it has to be the app; what's going on?",2.0,2025-04-13
Skylar Williams,"been using snap for awhile now, on a texting side of things it's fine but over time I've watched the app just get worse. I keep getting notifications about people's story's that I don't have added or notifications on, there's adds in my chat feeds now which is just low. I can't go to the discover tab and see anything interesting anymore just the stuff I want to see (cars videos, cats, ect.) is just soft core porn every other section in it. Just over time it became very annoying to use.",2.0,2025-04-10
Big Dad,"It's so slow and drains a lot of battery. It uses a lot of data and the camera is so bad compared to my actual camera on my phone. I guess you guys updated the app recently, and my camera keeps freezing. I have a galaxy s20fe and most of the filters that effect your face are laggy, but other androids and iPhones run it perfectly. Please fix. this is my favorite app to use and it's the slowest and worst app I have.",2.0,2025-03-26
JB XP,"The ads have increased SUBSTANTIALLY. Which is fine, they have to make money too. However, they are quite intrusive ads now. Also, the discover tab has moved finally, but it's still just blatantly in the way and you see some borderline inappropriate stuff pop up. Finally my biggest annoyance lately is the auto opening to front facing camera. It's quite annoying having to constantly flip it back to rear facing",3.0,2025-03-11
Valerie Smith,I installed this app to keep up with a few people that live hours away. All was fine until recently when I started receiving notifications every five minutes. It's usually for people I don't follow and couldn't care less about seeing their content. And if I delete the notifications the same ones pop right back up in seconds. It's intrusive and annoying!!!,1.0,2025-02-16
Jake Von Klapp (Jake),"My favorite and most used app on my phone.. I can only give 1 star though, forcing ads into my messages is so ridiculous and unnecessary. You have ads between friends stories, every like 5 to 10 seconds in every single video.. Throwing ads in my messages, moving people around, causing me to send things to the wrong people, that's trash.. you're about a step or 2 away from just being an ad app. Fix it",1.0,2025-03-24
Perri Pierce,My only complaint is that the songs I want to add to Snaps are NEVER available. Should be adding the artist's whole catalog instead of bits and pieces. Edit: Bring back the option to where we can block Team Snapchat. I don't care what they have to say at all. Edit 2: It would also help if we can choose which parts of the song we want to use instead of it being limited to a 15-30 second audio clip. Also ads need to stop popping up in the message section. Shouldn't have to pay for that option.,3.0,2025-02-27
gabby bove,I don't know if this app has a bug or something because I have turned off every notification possible for quick add and contacts and I'm still getting notifications in app and it won't disappear and it's annoying as hell.. Update 3/19/25. still get random notifications that won't go away. its annoying to deal with the stupid MY AI that you can't delete or at least get it off the top of your list. Anddd getting friend suggestions is fine but the notification doesn't go away for nothinggggg.,1.0,2025-03-19
Gabriela Grajeda,I do not like the new features. I'm tired of turning closed caption on every single story. I would appreciate it if you put it on and off in the main setting so that way I do not need to turn it on for each reel or story. I wouldn't rate this 5/5 because of reel and stories. impacts mental health or addicted to scrolling.,3.0,2025-03-20
Lillie Tracy,"I use snap everyday, and it is incredibly slow when loading. Whenever I click on ""stories"", the ""My Favorites"" will load and none of my other stories will load. So I can post on them but not see the memories sorted. The ""1 year ago"" also does not load. I've restarted my phone and deleted the app and redownloaded. I don't have connection or loading issues with any other app. This is very frustrating. Edit: this is still happening on 2/27/25 and i'm just going to stop paying for snapchat premium.",1.0,2025-02-27
David Amos,"I understand Snap Inc. wants to spend all their money to add AI to the app (not that I'm a fan) but cramming ads in EVERY crevice of this app makes it suck. There used to really only be ads in the filters, spotlight, story area, and OCCASIONALLY in the chat feed. Now there's ads in the story area, spotlight, filters, AND in the chat feed EVERY TIME I OPEN THE APP. EVERY. SECTION. HAS. ADS. I only pay for premium to access features that are useful to me, not to get rid of pushy ads. Do better.",1.0,2025-02-19
Abbigail Taylor,"Recently, I've been getting notifications for people's stories that I'm not following and have never heard of. This, and the inability to get rid of the snapchat team and AI conversations, is just invasive of my privacy and peace. I've been cutting back my usage of social media, but I WAS comfortable keeping snapchat because I was able to use it STRICTLY as a PRIVATE MESSAGING APP with a small list of my closest friends. Now, it's just trying to be like every other social media. I'm done!",1.0,2025-02-08
Dallen Anderson,"Over the course of the last year or so, snapchat has become more and more unfriendly to users who don't use their premium services. I don't mind having ads on extracurricular content that is distributed on snapchat, but ads on the app have become more and more invasive. Ads jump into spots where my most frequent chats are on the home screen. A garbage ""AI"" chatbot is forced to the top of my chat logs and there is no way to move it somewhere else, and I keep getting notifications I've turned off.",1.0,2025-02-09
William Carroll,this app sends the same notifications over and over and over. doesn't matter if I click them and open it up to view whoever's story it wants me to view i will get another notification for the same thing in 20-30 minutes. only option is to turn notifications off which kind of defeats the purpose of a messaging app. also none of my stories save to memories anymore. I've been in and out of all system and app settings and can't get that to work like it used to. these issues have been going for years,1.0,2025-04-09
Kassidy,"A mess... Text disappears, filters glitch constantly and get stuck halfway when scrolling through them, filters will randomly add themselves right before I send, video sound is never synced, the bizarre hypersexual clickbait content they've flooded the app with is only getting worse, the A.I. cannot be deleted from the top of my list (unless I pay a fee of course!), video notifications are an absolute nightmare, and the app crashes constantly. And they won't stop BEGGING me to pay for Snapchat+.",1.0,2025-02-23
GeekWad927,"Their ads on other apps are LONG, need to be closed +3x, & open outside the app, crashing the current app, losing all my progress, whether it's an art project or a game â€¢ â€¢ â€¢ Chat notis are linked to ""try this new lens"" notis, so you can't turn them off â€¢ MOST simple filters change your entire face so you don't even look like yourself.

Anthony Facca,"Not a huge fan of half-naked ""influencers"" and softcore porn being thrown in my face at the Discover page when I'm just trying to see my friends' stories. No matter how many accounts I block or hide, there's always 30 more ready to annoy me. It wouldn't be a problem if I could opt out of the discover page, or if it was its own thing instead of a terrible combination, but alas, all I can do is complain about gooners on a review nobody will ever read through.",2.0,2025-04-16
Lunchbox :v,"The multi snap feature is almost useless. You can't even save the entire thing as one clip, it's individually. It would be so much better to be able to save it as a full clip. I saved mines and only 15secs were saved. Then I can't even edit them before posting, making the whole process confusing and stressful. I even have auto save to memory on, and my multi snaps don't save too, making easy to lose everything ðŸ«¤ . Instagram allows you to recover deleted things, that would be great on snap.",2.0,2025-02-20
Aubrey Ross,"I have found this app to be quite impressive, particularly for texting purposes. However, I have encountered some issues with the calling feature. Specifically, the absence of a speakerphone option unless a video call is initiated is somewhat inconvenient. Furthermore, the audio on voice calls is often too quiet. On a more positive note, I enjoy the filters, which I find to be amusing and endearing. To enhance my experience, I would greatly appreciate it if a speakerphone option should be added.",3.0,2025-01-19

I can't go to the discover tab and see anything interesting anymore just the stuff I want to see (cars videos, cats, ect.) is just soft core porn every other section in it. Just over time it became very annoying to use.",2.0,2025-04-10
Big Dad,"It's so slow and drains a lot of battery. It uses a lot of data and the camera is so bad compared to my actual camera on my phone. I guess you guys updated the app recently, and my camera keeps freezing. I have a galaxy s20fe and most of the filters that effect your face are laggy, but other androids and iPhones run it perfectly. Please fix. this is my favorite app to use and it's the slowest and worst app I have.",2.0,2025-03-26
JB XP,"The ads have increased SUBSTANTIALLY. Which is fine, they have to make money too. However, they are quite intrusive ads now. Also, the discover tab has moved finally, but it's still just blatantly in the way and you see some borderline inappropriate stuff pop up. Finally my biggest annoyance lately is the auto opening to front facing camera. It's quite annoying having to constantly flip it back to rear facing",3.0,2025-03-11
Valerie Smith,I installed this app to keep up with a few people that live hours away. All was fine until recently when I started receiving notifications every five minutes. It's usually for people I don't follow and couldn't care less about seeing their content. And if I delete the notifications the same ones pop right back up in seconds. It's intrusive and annoying!!!,1.0,2025-02-16
Jake Von Klapp (Jake),"My favorite and most used app on my phone.. I can only give 1 star though, forcing ads into my messages is so ridiculous and unnecessary. You have ads between friends stories, every like 5 to 10 seconds in every single video.. Throwing ads in my messages, moving people around, causing me to send things to the wrong people, that's trash.. you're about a step or 2 away from just being an ad app. Fix it",1.0,2025-03-24
Perri Pierce,My only complaint is that the songs I want to add to Snaps are NEVER available. Should be adding the artist's whole catalog instead of bits and pieces. Edit: Bring back the option to where we can block Team Snapchat. I don't care what they have to say at all. Edit 2: It would also help if we can choose which parts of the song we want to use instead of it being limited to a 15-30 second audio clip. Also ads need to stop popping up in the message section. Shouldn't have to pay for that option.,3.0,2025-02-27
gabby bove,I don't know if this app has a bug or something because I have turned off every notification possible for quick add and contacts and I'm still getting notifications in app and it won't disappear and it's annoying as hell.. Update 3/19/25. still get random notifications that won't go away. its annoying to deal with the stupid MY AI that you can't delete or at least get it off the top of your list. Anddd getting friend suggestions is fine but the notification doesn't go away for nothinggggg.,1.0,2025-03-19
Gabriela Grajeda,I do not like the new features. I'm tired of turning closed caption on every single story. I would appreciate it if you put it on and off in the main setting so that way I do not need to turn it on for each reel or story. I wouldn't rate this 5/5 because of reel and stories. impacts mental health or addicted to scrolling.,3.0,2025-03-20
Lillie Tracy,"I use snap everyday, and it is incredibly slow when loading. Whenever I click on ""stories"", the ""My Favorites"" will load and none of my other stories will load. So I can post on them but not see the memories sorted. The ""1 year ago"" also does not load. I've restarted my phone and deleted the app and redownloaded. I don't have connection or loading issues with any other app. This is very frustrating.

David Amos,"I understand Snap Inc. wants to spend all their money to add AI to the app (not that I'm a fan) but cramming ads in EVERY crevice of this app makes it suck. There used to really only be ads in the filters, spotlight, story area, and OCCASIONALLY in the chat feed. Now there's ads in the story area, spotlight, filters, AND in the chat feed EVERY TIME I OPEN THE APP. EVERY. SECTION. HAS. ADS. I only pay for premium to access features that are useful to me, not to get rid of pushy ads. Do better.",1.0,2025-02-19
Abbigail Taylor,"Recently, I've been getting notifications for people's stories that I'm not following and have never heard of. This, and the inability to get rid of the snapchat team and AI conversations, is just invasive of my privacy and peace. I've been cutting back my usage of social media, but I WAS comfortable keeping snapchat because I was able to use it STRICTLY as a PRIVATE MESSAGING APP with a small list of my closest friends. Now, it's just trying to be like every other social media. I'm done!",1.0,2025-02-08
Dallen Anderson,"Over the course of the last year or so, snapchat has become more and more unfriendly to users who don't use their premium services. I don't mind having ads on extracurricular content that is distributed on snapchat, but ads on the app have become more and more invasive. Ads jump into spots where my most frequent chats are on the home screen. A garbage ""AI"" chatbot is forced to the top of my chat logs and there is no way to move it somewhere else, and I keep getting notifications I've turned off.",1.0,2025-02-09
William Carroll,this app sends the same notifications over and over and over. doesn't matter if I click them and open it up to view whoever's story it wants me to view i will get another notification for the same thing in 20-30 minutes. only option is to turn notifications off which kind of defeats the purpose of a messaging app. also none of my stories save to memories anymore. I've been in and out of all system and app settings and can't get that to work like it used to. these issues have been going for years,1.0,2025-04-09

Anthony Facca,"Not a huge fan of half-naked ""influencers"" and softcore porn being thrown in my face at the Discover page when I'm just trying to see my friends' stories. No matter how many accounts I block or hide, there's always 30 more ready to annoy me. It wouldn't be a problem if I could opt out of the discover page, or if it was its own thing instead of a terrible combination, but alas, all I can do is complain about gooners on a review nobody will ever read through.",2.0,2025-04-16
Lunchbox :v,"The multi snap feature is almost useless. You can't even save the entire thing as one clip, it's individually. It would be so much better to be able to save it as a full clip.

Aubrey Ross,"I have found this app to be quite impressive, particularly for texting purposes. However, I have encountered some issues with the calling feature. Specifically, the absence of a speakerphone option unless a video call is initiated is somewhat inconvenient. Furthermore, the audio on voice calls is often too quiet. On a more positive note, I enjoy the filters, which I find to be amusing and endearing.

Jennifer Luke,"New update is absolute garbage. I just want to see my friends' stories, not ads and random ""discover"" stories. Put things back where they were.

John Walton,"Dumb app, extremely basic, annoying to use, but some people I know outright REFUSE to communicate any other way, so I'm here.
