Perry Bdg,"""I've been using WhatsApp for years, and it's been my go-to messaging app. I love its simplicity and reliability. The voice call feature is particularly useful for staying in touch with friends and family abroad. However, I've noticed some occasional lag when sending files. Overall, WhatsApp is a solid choice for anyone looking for a hassle-free messaging experience?.""",5.0,2025-01-14
Reinan Mortiz,"The chat is good, but for video calls the volume control is frustrating since it does not allow for precise settings. The lowest call volume setting is still loud enough for everyone around to hear. The app also does not allow for listening to music through Spotify or multitasking like that while on a video call, which is also something I hope could be updated in the near future.",3.0,2025-01-11
Sebastian Fuller,"They just made the worst possible UI update. Before if I wanted to send a photo, it would just show ALL the albums in my gallery on the app to select and send. Now, it ONLY shows recents and my cloud stored albums. And there's no way to access or view my other albums not in the Google cloud, in the app. So I have to go to my gallery, find the photo, and then ""share"" it to the chat in whatsapp. Why they made this awful change? I have no idea. It worked perfectly fine.",3.0,2025-01-12
Rafael Sarante,"The new system to share photos and videos is so tedious. I have a lot photos and videos on my phone organized by album so I can locate them easily and the new system implemented by WhatsApp takes a lot of time to get to the album option. First show the most recent and then we have to tap Recently for it give us some of the albums, but if it isn't the one you're looking for a wait is due so the See More option pops up and that takes so long and have to mention the extras steps now.",3.0,2025-01-13
Lavendeer 201,"Custom stickers are a pain, gifs need to continue playing, and the latest update is awful for photos! I used to be able to see all my albums, but now I can only select from Downloads, Camera, Screenshots, and other preselected albums. This makes it VERY DIFFICULT to find the things I want to send to friends and family. Additionally, the typing and correcting spelling is very glitchy/frustrating now. Besides that, it's great for communication without cell service, and is much better than SMS!",3.0,2024-12-28
Connor Mahoney,"It's a messenger app I primarily use for its voice message feature. The voice messages portion is a hot mess. Sometimes the app tries to route the audio to the headset speaker instead of the normal one. Sometimes it'll black out and lock the screen while playing, which forces you to restart the whole message. Sometimes your recording is interrupted by a text or app popup, requiring the whole recording to be redone as it drops the whole voice message entirely if you didn't finish it. Hot. Mess.",3.0,2025-01-02
Jade Hassall,"It's great for typing but video and voice calls drop constantly. After about a minute, the call states ""reconnecting"" and then drops. You can't report it to WhatsApp either as they don't provide chat or email support for technical issues regarding calls. As for being able to send pictures - good luck. It barely allows you to find any pictures anymore! Since the update, things have been so much worse.",3.0,2025-01-06

Sidra Siddique,"From my point of view, WhatsApp is a fantastic messaging app that makes it easy to stay in touch with friends and family. I appreciate its simplicity and the ability to send messages, share photos, and make voice or video calls for free. The end-to-end encryption gives me peace of mind about privacy. However, I also see the downside of constant notifications and the pressure to respond quickly. Overall, I think WhatsApp is a great tool for communication, as long as itâ€™s used mindfully.",2.0,2024-12-30
Levi Zammit,"Please fix your Bluetooth issue for playback of audio messages. I cannot play audio messages unless I have some other music playing, in which case it speaks over the music which is annoying. If I pause the music the message appears to be playing and no sound comes out. This only happens when connected to a Bluetooth device IE car or headphones. I have a pixel 7 Pro with all recent/relevant updates to app and OS.",1.0,2024-12-30
