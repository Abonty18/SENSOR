Gunnar Molstad,"App has gone down hill a lot since the restructuring and new management. It's clear that the app barely works anymore. It still functions, but it isn't what it claimed to be years ago. Community has gone under as well, people are only on it because they feel they have to be. I've deleted my accounts and I'm uninstalling. Update: reinstalled to see if it really is as bad as I remember. It is. uninstalling again.",1.0,2024-12-31T04:53:24Z
christos nikitopoulos,"X is dynamic, intuitive, and engaging. Its interface is user-friendly with options like dark mode. Content is varied, from news to arts. Community engagement is strong, allowing for real-time discussions and networking. Features like Spaces add depth to interactions. Accessible across devices, X delivers a tailored, vibrant social experience.",5.0,2024-12-31T17:07:49Z
Khaleed Uddin,"The app itself is fine. About twice a day there will be times where the app doesn't load a new feed for a couple of times. Can't look at new tweets, load images, or like tweets until it refreshes automatically. Edit 2 months later: it's getting worse and it doesn't load at all. Almost the end of 2024: and the app itself is still not fixed with the loading.",1.0,2024-12-15T21:46:02Z
Luke (Doomcaster),"Ads have increased 10x compared to a few years back. I'm talking video ads before the actual ad plays it's own video. On top of that, I've been having to scroll past 5-8 ads in series before reaching another REAL post. 90% of all ads I see are from Temu, a company I have no interest in. A subscription is not a fix for this. I've been a user for 11 years, and this is getting ridiculous.",1.0,2024-12-15T21:11:52Z
Ihab Eid,"Bring the old search features. I would like to see some search features that filter posts from 1 hour, 1 day, 1 month, etc. There's so many other problems I don't feel like bringing up. This app has really gone downhill since it became 'X'. I miss old twitter. At least it was usable as a news search. Now it's become a dumpster fire.",2.0,2024-12-07T23:05:24Z
Marissa D,"every night around the same time, it has moments where it just won't load anything. all the pictures turn black and it just spins and spins, and I can't see or do anything. it's not my internet because all my other apps work perfectly fine. There's so many bugs, also my feed is filled with posts from everyone BUT the people I follow. And I HATE the auto-scroll after each video, so unnecessary.",1.0,2024-12-22T04:08:56Z
Kohner Morgan,"DOESN'T WORK IF YOU'RE CHARGING YOUR PHONE. The app randomly completely stops loading new posts a few times a day and completely ceases to work for up to an hour. It's been doing this for close to a year. Today, I figured out it only happens when my phone is on the charger. As soon as I unplug my phone, the app starts working again. What a stupid bug that should be such an easy fix.",2.0,2024-12-08T21:35:09Z
Stephen,"Ads are now embedded in the home page, so you can't block ad accounts that bother you, and if they have videos with sound, they will autoplay with sound regardless of your settings and feed will auto snap up or down to nearby ads to keep them fully on screen. Also, the app now won't work while charging your phone. Seriously. Try using the app right after you plug in your phone, and it just won't work. The feed will still have some cached images and posts but you are unable to interact with posts",1.0,2024-12-04T09:50:57Z
Stephen Coursey,"Constant bugs with this app. Half the time you go to use it posts don't load, comments don't load, timeline won't refresh, search bar won't work. It's as if you turned on airplane mode while the app was partially loaded - and there's no way to fix it. And when the app does actually work, it will refresh constantly while youre in the middle of reading something, only for that post to completely disappear when you try to find it again. The bugs are outrageous.",2.0,2024-12-05T16:43:29Z
Johnny Pauline,"The content filter isn't working; I have it set to not show any sensitive media at all, and that's all it shows. I report the media; they say it's allowed, even though it's only allowed if it's labeled correctly, which it isn't because it's getting past their filters, but they don't care. There's no way to contact support or seem to talk to a real person unless I pay $30 for a membership.",1.0,2024-12-28T14:00:50Z
LN Neu,"There is no support on contact us? Just the same feed of possible answers for questions you've never had.. When I post, X shows that I have posted. Put my draft box is completely full of failed to send posts. What the heck? Although I turned notifications on, it shows 25 and there are only 2... or it shows 16 and there are 3... nothing seems to work right on this app anymore! Each update it gets worse!",2.0,2024-12-19T17:51:55Z
Bob Wasko,"App freezes, stops, and doesn't work 1/2 the time. I have to continually restart my phone for X to work. Only app I use that does this. It's not my phone. Content is great when it works. This is the only app I use that continues to freeze, spin, not update, etc. What's going on!? Have to restart my phone and hope that works. Updated 8-3-2024. Can't use it this morning because it's stuck on yesterday's last view. Nothing will play or open. I have a newer phone and every other app works fine",2.0,2024-12-23T03:32:55Z
Nicolas Mitchell,"I enjoy the app, but the interface is at times confusing. Many times when I refresh the app to see the latest posts, or trends I end up getting posts that are from 2 days ago. And as more video content comes to X it would be nice to have an interface similar to YouTube's where you can look at videos from subscribed channels. In a nutshell I would just like to see an interface that simplifies the experience a little bit.",4.0,2024-12-10T16:18:54Z
William Pinner,"This app has gotten worse and worse over the last year or more. I've been a user for years and never had problems with the Android app, but now it fails to load content in a timely fashion regularly, freezes or hangs multiple times a day, and is generally becoming unusable. It's like they're purposefully making it worse with every ""update"". It's wild, as compared to my iPad app, that works exactly like it used to.",1.0,2024-10-17T12:10:37Z
Katie A.,"great app if you like 5 ads in a row, one post from someone you don't follow, and then another 3 ads. sometimes won't load at all. notifications get super buggy. sometimes when you're trying to make a post, it'll just stop working. real quality. not to mention all the bogus updates that keep rolling out to ""improve"" experience - not sure whose experience it's making better, but it sure isn't most users'.",1.0,2024-10-17T06:29:34Z
Josh Hines,"ùïè has great features, and I really enjoy the user experience. However, I'm continually running into technical issues like the timeline just randomly not loading (not due to network problems on my end, other apps and websites work just fine). It's a shame because I want to love this app, but it's just too buggy. Hopefully, the developers will release some stability updates soon. Until then, I sadly can only give it 2 stars.",2.0,2024-11-06T05:58:13Z
Arturo Garcia,"This app used to be almost flawless. Once they changed the top replies to prioritize premium users instead of the top likes or interactions it basically ruined the app. Now all the top replies are bots, it's not even worth looking at the replies because it takes too long to get to the actual decent replies. The feed randomly refreshing unprovoked is also awful and it's been occuring for about 6 months now. Those changes are what prompted me to review it so harshly.",1.0,2024-12-31T04:52:38Z
A Chandler,"Every update makes this app worse and worse. Half the time it does not even work, stuck in an endless loop of error messages and crashes. Now they are changing the block feature to still allow people you have blocked to view your profile even if they cannot interact with it, completely defeating the purpose of the feature. It is fostering an incredibly hostile environment and running it into the ground.",1.0,2024-10-17T17:24:43Z
Jonathan Wilson,"One, the app is increasingly full of disturbing content. I just saw the creepiest bit of some music to the sexualization of children. I rarely go on here and just downloaded the app and this is the horrible stuff I get? It's full of mostly misleading, lying and polarizing content. On top of this the app barely functions, it's gotta video controls on top of video controls, keeps on bouncing around whenever you try to change one thing. Shocking at how bad the video controls are. I could go on...",1.0,2024-11-01T10:32:32Z
Matt F,"The app will randomly stop working and just fail to load for hours on end. The browser version works fine when this happens, but without the same functionality. I like the platform, but the app is terrible because of this. It's like it's just stuck with no internet. No amount of restarting the app can fix it either. I even restarted the device and it still won't work.",2.0,2024-10-28T21:07:45Z
