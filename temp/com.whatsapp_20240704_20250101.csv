Lavendeer 201,"Custom stickers are a pain, gifs need to continue playing, and the latest update is awful for photos! I used to be able to see all my albums, but now I can only select from Downloads, Camera, Screenshots, and other preselected albums. This makes it VERY DIFFICULT to find the things I want to send to friends and family. Additionally, the typing and correcting spelling is very glitchy/frustrating now. Besides that, it's great for communication without cell service, and is much better than SMS!",3.0,2024-12-28T15:54:13Z
Rob Dinkel,"Great app for staying in contact with people around the world. An absolute lifesaver when traveling. If there was one suggestion I could make: A native language translator feature is sorely missing. Add something that detects a foreign language and offers to translate in one touch. When I develop apps, I can integrate this feature easily with a tool like Microsoft Translator. Adding this feature is low hanging fruit and millions would adore this improvement.",4.0,2024-12-18T18:27:57Z
Bobbie Cole,"Finally found the hidden list bar at the top. I found that I had to swipe down in order to see it. Why is it hidden in the first place? It should be shown as default! ... *App could use ""scheduled messages"" to send a text later in the day. ... Also could use the ability to pin more (up to 8) conversations to the top. ... *Ability to have photo albums shown in alphabetical order would be best for faster searching for photos to attach to conversations.",2.0,2024-12-18T15:24:21Z
Carl Kemp,"So why exactly is it that you STILL haven't mastered the arcane art of editing text messages on Android??? Everybody else seems to have it down pat. At least half a dozen times, I have tried to edit a message that I sent, only to have my edits disappear as soon as I confirm them! Seriously, why even offer an edit feature if you have no intention of actually implementing it???",2.0,2024-12-20T21:40:47Z
Antonymous User,"Great app if you have wifi and need to pop off a few text messages but if you use it to make a call, prepare to get frustrated and angry. You'll get about 30 seconds before either you can't hear them or they can't hear you. This ""feature"" is worthless and shouldn't be advertised. I don't want any ""get ahold of so and so to help solve the problem"" I just want it fixed",1.0,2024-12-21T15:40:26Z
Nya Wilson,"Since the last update on this App, in mid December, I am now unable to access all my photos and videos from my phone through WhatsApp. All of my updates on my phone and this App are current. All of my permissions for this App are also in Allowed status. There is no support to help me figure why this is all of a sudden an issue. Help center is no help and they don't have Tech agents for Media, to speak with via chat or email! How?! When your entire App is based on Media sharing?! üò§",1.0,2024-12-31T16:06:54Z
hu trillz,"Just started using the app and I'd happily give 5 stars if it were solely based on the product's simplicity design, and operating abilities, however I'd like to make 2 (obvious) suggestions. 1. Being a translate feature and perhaps have in settings a setting to set your preferred translating language. Also, on the topic, many prominent websites are offering live video call translating capabilities, might be worth considering. 2. A more clear account/profile accessibility button/page/feature.",4.0,2024-12-07T08:48:36Z
Dimitri Ajazi,"The app itself, as a chat client, at least seems to be fine. The service itself is terribly buggy. Via web, I was trying to upload an icon for a group of just two family members and my account suddenly got blocked. The icon wasn't offensive in any way. What gives? I can't even delete the account. But WA can sell my contact list, can't it.",1.0,2024-12-19T14:14:32Z
Dennis Mikhail,Why is it so difficult to fix this app? It should not stop playing voice messages whenever a shadow comes across the light sensor on the phone I don't understand why that's even a built-in feature there's absolutely no use for that. On top of the fact it likes to pause while you're recording and sometimes records and other times doesn't. Doesn't seem like very big issues to fix so please do so.,1.0,2024-12-15T21:06:28Z
Benjamin Murphy,"I downloaded this app because my friends are on it, and wanted me to join them. In trying to setup my account, it reach a point where it needs to send me an SMS message to verify my phone number. I never receive the message, and then it tells me I have to wait 48 hours to try again. I've tried all of the obvious things, like checking my permissions settings. There is no option to contact support without having an existing account, which I obviously can't setup. So the app is completely unusable.",1.0,2024-12-06T21:53:40Z
Guess Who,"WhatsApp Is a Mess! Everyone I came in contact with suggested I get this app, so I downloaded it. I find it very complicated, difficult, and frustrating to use. Instructions aren't clear. It's not user friendly. I don't keep a contact list so I can't invite other users. I can't even invite users with my QR code because I can't copy it. This app has been a collosal waste of my time and I've gotten nowhere. Notify me when this app can at least make it easy for me to invite people to connect with.",1.0,2024-12-21T15:33:13Z
Scott Phillips,"Locked my account at a critical time. Do not trust this app. I signed up and started using this app to communicate with a travel provider while travelling internationally. I only sent messages to two travel providers, an airbnb host and a car rental I currently have a car from. Whatsapp locked my account due to spam for no reason. I can't communicate with the car rental company and desperately need to contact them to return the car before my flight.",1.0,2024-12-16T18:47:08Z
Brenda Lew,"I AM SICK AND TIRED OF THE FORCED BLURRING WHEN I USE THE FRONT CAMERA. Yes, I double checked that backgrounds and filters were off. It still happens. This is a pain in the behind when I'm trying to show an object from the front as it blurs it out. and it makes the quality look trash. META, GIVE PEOPLE THE OPTION TO TURN THIS FEATURE OFF.",1.0,2024-12-22T20:54:29Z
Sbanga419,"I recently got a new Samsung Galaxy s24 Ultra and am having trouble with the restoration of the end to end encrypted data. The end to end encryption code can not be accessed at all; neither the data is able to be accessed with a password or passkey from WhatsApp. Other than that, WhatsApp would be working totally at its bestüëå!",3.0,2024-12-09T04:14:33Z
James Brown,"Almost perfect chat app. The pros: integration with existing contacts list. Breadth of options for messaging (voice, video, call, text, gift, emoji plus reactions). Quality of pictures and video shared and received. Ease of searching previously sent media. The cons: frequent backups. Lack of schedule send option. Extraneous features like status updates and communities. Lack of ability to send a message to multiple people without creating a new group.",4.0,2024-12-04T13:24:16Z
ana a,"I used to love this app, but recently got a new phone and it's been very difficult to use it. When get a call, my phone is ringing but to pick it up, have to open the app and look for the incoming call. tried to change it in the setting but with the curent software app doesn't allow pop-up notifications. Alsolused to be able turn off automatic download of the attachments, currently this operation is not available.",1.0,2024-12-08T02:23:57Z
Sony Nicolson,"Messaging is fast and reliable. However it does crunch the media quality, even when selecting the HD option. Also, getting any sort of calls when the app is not open is an absolute nightmare. It doesn't snooze when pressing the sound buttons and if the screen is locked it's very annoying to try to navigate to the calling screen to swipe up the Respond With Text option. It is really frustrating since the app has less issues with calls on iOS devices",3.0,2024-12-06T07:54:51Z
Omar Crespo,"What did you guys do to the Gallery in the attachment option?! I wanted to share a picture from within the app and only a few folders showed up in 'More Folders'. So, either I have to share something from outside the app or scroll through my recents all the way back to two years or something looking for that something to share. Like you're a low quality app... Seriously, if it's not broken, don't fix it!!",1.0,2024-11-02T09:15:16Z
Ricardo Garc√≠a Fern√°ndez,"The app works great overall. However, it has some relatively small issues which tend to be very annoying. When listening to a voice note while my ear is on the phone, the screen goes to black immediately as expected. However, it goes back to be active after a bit even when still listening to the note. This causes the audio to stop and the UI to be reactive to the touch of my ear. I've experienced this issue for a while now. Looks like the screen gets back to active after 30 seconds.",2.0,2024-11-01T19:28:29Z
MsXochi Avalos,"Can we create a setting to turn updates off /no notifications? It's very annoying Keeping this üëâüèº Take the extra met√† button off on bottom right! We already have it in the search button which is already not great in my opinion. But 2 is overdoing it. Stop! And, you took the star üåü away for messages and you put a bookmark! How innovative is that?! It's not! It's boring. It's like a work app. WhatsApp keeps things fun. Stop changing little things! If it's not broken, leave it alone.",2.0,2024-10-21T01:16:36Z
