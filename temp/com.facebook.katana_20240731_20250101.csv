E. Dawg B.,"All pretty much good, except the app could have descriptions for what some of the buttons/options do (like the ""crosspost"" which is pretty self-explanatory but showed that I was going to post to the two groups that I selected as well as ""Public"" which I could find no explanation for anywhere!). And also, I am still wondering why they haven't fixed what seems like a glitch, with pages auto updating - especially the ones I'm looking at and planning on replying to (and then disappearing)!",4.0,2024-12-16T21:35:29Z
Geoff K,"12/11/24 With the last update, it consistently fails. It won't go to pressed tabs. Can't see notifications, messages or the like. When able to get to messages, can't reply to messages. Tried uninstalling w/ no luck. _______ This used to be a decent app. In the last few months, most images on profiles (even mine) show up as a black screen. I had the issue on my original phone, cleared the memory cache, but still had the issue. I got a replacement phone, and still have that problem. Please help!",1.0,2024-12-12T04:41:03Z
Paige Bailey,"So videos. 1. Why is the bottom half darkened? It's makes it hard to see some things. 2. Why is the countdown to next video ""cancel"" so hard to push? I keep pausing or muting the video until it ends up changing to the next one anyway. 3. When it does change to the next video why does it cut off the last second of the previous? These are short videos so it would be nice to see the whole thing. 4. Why does it immediately take me back to the next vid after trying to go back to the first?",1.0,2024-12-11T02:02:44Z
JANEE DISTURBED,"There's a lot of things that could be done better. starting with how the page jumps and you lose EVERYTHING while you're working on a message. That gets lost. Or like right now as I type this, the box is jumping all over the place! How do you make it stop? And the Draft situation has GOT to be fixed. I can save a draft or hope that my message drafts and it doesn't. Instead, it gets lost in no man's land. But that never happens. And a bunch of work ends up for naught. Wasted time too.",1.0,2024-11-16T15:10:30Z
Anna Patterson,"Tabs is a useless feature. There is no information about it in the help center or online. No matter what link you hit, even by accident, it remains open in tabs! There is 0 way to access tabs without clicking on a random link. From there you can see what links are open and close them. If you forget, well, then you have to find another random link to click. I can't even find where I can report this to the help center anymore. So, I came here.",1.0,2024-12-15T20:47:44Z
Blackstone Cherry,"Don't use the dating app. It's as broken as the rest of it. Matches from outside preferences (must have on) and wonky interface. Notification. Notification. Notification. Oh none of these have a single thing to do with me. I can only turn every single notification off using my phone's ability to block app notifications, but the others either dont have options for in the notification settings or negate the fact it's supposed to be off in the first place",1.0,2024-11-23T08:04:33Z
Angel Avalos Aguilar,"I like Facebook. Its a very good app. But there are a few glitches, like sometims, you're feed doesn't refresh, and you're stuck with the same posts/feed over and over again, no matter if you refresh or reopen the app. And thats another thing. While that glitch is happening, you can't refresh Facebook, it glitches out, and the refresh circle that pops up goes very fast. Its annoying. Also, I try and get my feed to change, by clicking ""show less"", ""hide reels"" etc, but the stuff keeps coming back",3.0,2024-10-22T23:33:44Z
Bridget Phillippi,"I would have to say I use Facebook everyday to talk to people but I noticed since I've updated it, it won't allow me to see my cover picture nor anybody else's at that matter as wellü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è not sure what to do. I've uninstalled it completely as well and it didn't fix the cover picture problem but its quite frustrating. Any help is appreciated, thanks! I will change to a 5 star if someone can help me get the cover photos thing fixed.",2.0,2024-11-09T10:49:23Z
Leona Dorothy,"A lot of bugs. Cannot properly respond to events (overlay sheet is all white with no options), for example. Reporting them doesn't seem to get them fixed, either. Also, why is this app so bloated ?! Internal browser is awful and now is accumulating tabs that don't close. Keep hoping it'll improve, but keeps deteriorating.",1.0,2024-11-02T21:52:31Z
Lacey Myers-Davis,I use Facebook pretty much on a daily basis for a blog. It's a great place to connect with family and friends. And post all kinds of amazing moments in life ‚ù§Ô∏è the only thing I don't like is even whenever Facebook doesn't need to be updated it still manages to show posts from a week ago. Even after 2 days of not being on Facebook. I really wish they would fix this or make it to where the if it acts like this make it happen early update of some type,4.0,2024-11-30T18:40:09Z
Sgt Luke,"Sometimes I use it. I do have a question about the app though: Why does it have to be a system app? I'm editing this to add something. For some reason, when you have the option for auto update off, it will still perform an auto update. It even auto updates when you're on Wi-Fi as I've seen it try to update, but won't as it says waiting for Wi-Fi in order to update. Even removing all updates it will inevitably update without your permission.",4.0,2024-11-21T22:52:48Z
Richard Beck-Boudreaux,"Facebook has become unrecognizable from what it once was. I login today and 9 out of every 10 posts are ads (recommendations for pages I'm not following and random video reels are considered ads). I find it incredibly difficult to tailor my experience to actually seeing posts from friends, or anything I'm actually interested in. it's like the Internet in the 90's without ad blockers. this is just really such a terrible awful social network that does not function as a social network anymore.",1.0,2024-11-06T14:51:50Z
Evan Prowse,"The app is specifically designed to put you through doomscroll hell. In the past, when you wanted to watch reels, you had the option, then they started making you opt out of the automatic scrolling per video to stay on the one you selected. NOW, YOU CANT EVEN HIT CANCEL, WHEN YOU DO, IT JUST PAUSES THE VIDEO, AND THAT DOESNT EVEN WORK SOMETIMES. THIS IS WHY WE MILLENIALS ARE **ABANDONING** OUR META ACCOUNTS!!!",1.0,2024-11-02T14:27:02Z
Steve Mack,"They keep breaking features. As of the Oct. 2 l, 2024 update I can't search for friends anymore. The search works but when I click on a result or the right arrow beside it nothing at all happens. And the increasing deluge of ads makes me reluctant to open the app to begin with. The idea of staying connected is great but the reality is falling far short.",3.0,2024-10-08T00:09:37Z
Benjamin Valumour,"It blows up my phone with notifications and I DON'T EVEN USE IT. The only reason I had it was for Messages and Messages doesn't even open on my phone for whatever reason. I've tried turning off the notifications, disabling the app and uninstalling it. The craziest thing ever is that it somehow reinstalled itself? And now I can't Uninstall it AT ALL!! It gives me so much grief when I need to have my phone notifications on for work by notifying me every half hour, this is absolutely ridiculous.",1.0,2024-12-21T19:10:39Z
New York,"10/3/24: Great update! Negative 17 stars. 75% advertising posts instead of my friends. A lot of times, clicking on stuff doesn't work, so I have to close the app and reopen it. And now it's showing that the app is using way too much storage on my device, which shows a problem to my device's health!! Certain words gets your page flagged but meanwhile I regularly see sexual explicit videos, pics and ads throughout the site. And yall want me to make a thread account... I THINK NOT",1.0,2024-10-03T08:30:43Z
Shariah Montelongo,"It's slow loading, always randomly closing articles and the app itself, way too many permissions, takes up too much space, crashes when I'm not even using it, and the video buffering is horrendous. The app also post blocking for no reason is absurd and discrimantory. Let's not forget actual PORN being forced on you in the reels as ADS. Why did I see a woman spreading her lips after watching a travel video??? Please fix it.",1.0,2024-10-12T15:29:47Z
Destiny,"I cannot scroll through my memories without the entire thing completely loading sometimes. It doesn't do it right away, but it starts. It also starts freezing very badly, something it didn't do before. And the newsfeed refreshes randomly when I click away from it. Now it completely goes back out of memories if I try to check memory post comments. I am deleting this horrible app, I am tired of it.",1.0,2024-09-29T00:07:53Z
Garrett Seelinger,"Truly a horrendous app. I can't believe how much worse it has gotten over the years. General functionality is on a steady decline. The notifications inexplicably don't load much of the time. Sub-comments are often shown as responding to the wrong comment. No way to customize or disable intrusive features. If you select a push notification it almost never navigates you to the relevant place. If you download an app because of an ad, it will auto-launch the app. Using Pixel6a btw",1.0,2024-09-13T19:26:54Z
Wolf Priest (Anarxur),"Looks good. Works well. Uninstalled because the app forces me to use an internal browser. This means that for YouTube links I have to tap into the FB browser, tap a menu and select open in external browser (Chrome), and then do this a third time to actually get it the YouTube link to open in YouTube. Now I just run FB right in Chrome and one tap opens links where I want them to, not where an app tells me I have to.",1.0,2024-10-12T17:42:45Z
