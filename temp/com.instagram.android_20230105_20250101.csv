Kursten,"I've used Instagram since it started up and had little to no issues. Until recently. I cannot edit photos without them going black after going into a couple of them. It's even worse if I try to upload more than 10. The actual photo editing portion is awful now as well. What is the point of having to go into one setting, then going right back to the start? It was much easier when all the options were there when you finished one adjustment.",2.0,2024-12-26T16:16:04Z
Amanda Maldonado,"Idk what's going on, but the latest update is super buggy. I'm frustrated. I have to back out multiple times just to edit a photo and start over several times. The filters sometimes don't pop up, and then the menu gets stuck, and I have to close the app and start over. I also hate the new setup for the edit buttons. Each edit for brightness or contrast other similar settings you make it sends you back to menu. I miss the old way. It was definitely easier to edit posts. Fix it meta.

Valerie Sheets,"I've been working on editing a reel for a few days—it's my 2024 year in review. I edit a bit, save as a draft, and come back to it. Since late last night, when I go to edit the reel, my editor area opens, freezes, and either kicks me out of the draft or kicks me out of the app completely. I've cleared my cache, I have the most recent app update, restarted my phone, checked to make sure my phone's overall storage has room, have a good connection. Please fix this.",3.0,2024-12-29T14:25:43Z
Trevor Ekin,"I know how to swipe. Stop doing your little partial auto swipe when I'm looking at a reel, yes, I know that's how I get to the next dang reel, maybe I'm just trying to watch this one again?? Ever thought of that??

Mabel,Enshittification has truly reached Instagram. I've been an Instagram user for over a decade and used multiple platforms (web/iOS/Android) and each update now seems to break something and results in poor user experience.

Eleanor Austin,12/25/24 - Instangram sucks now. Nothing but ads just like Facebook. Not sure what the point is anymore.... Not sure what the last update did but now I have a white background and can't see some writing because the font is in the same color as the background (or almost the same).

Now, I have to refresh the reel up to 10 times or close out IG then reopen it just for them to play. I end up spending more time trying to get them working than it would take for it to just play.

Shane Beaudry,"Normally, love, but not right now. I've been experiencing bugs and been sending reports. My biggest is posting in general. It will not let me expand ratio in post preview, nor does it show a preview of my post. If I edit the ratio in the next editing screen it stretches and distorts the image. It's maining with videos and I haven't posted videos in about 3 weeks. I don't have this issue on my side account for my writer quotes. I've done everything I can with restarts and updates. Nothing works.",2.0,2024-11-28T15:51:12Z

Brandon “B R A N N N” Connell,"My IG experience has been cool over the years, but periodically, something always goes wrong. When such issues arise, I think actual LIVE SUPPORT would be ideal. Articles detailing what to do are not helpful without live support behind it because things happen differently to everyone's phones. Ultimately, I'd like to see LIVE SUPPORT added to the help section. It's just pointless opinions and advice if it doesn't necessarily pertain to what's happening.",1.0,2024-12-03T15:24:23Z
Angel Suarez,"The constantly changing where buttons are, adding and removing features, none of which are things anybody usually wants. A toxic algorithm, censorship of people standing up against evil, while excusing and ignoring reports of actual hate speech and dangerous activities, bugs like crazy, and now AI built in? On top of that, every time I close the app, it tries to access my camera? In fact, because I keep my camera off by default, every time I close the app, it reopens to try and take a picture?",1.0,2024-12-09T00:16:48Z
Sam,"Posting process is excruciating. It's either my photos are glitching, a photo that was there in the editing process nowhere to be seen when posted, or pictures that weren't zoomed in being zoomed in when posted. I can't post one thing without having to delete multiple times and retry because something went wrong. The zooming in though, is a major let down, as no matter how many times I repost, it goes back to being zoomed in.",2.0,2024-11-13T05:59:22Z
Tony Vega,"App is unusable now because of bugs. I don't know what y'all did, but every time i try and open up the app now, it closes out right after and keeps crashing repeatedly. I've cleared cache, date, and even uninstalled and reinstalled the app to no avail. Y'ALL NEED TO FIX THIS NOW, because your updates have been nothing but pathetic lately.

aaron gritsch,"For the most part the site is great. I can look at the pics and videos all day as the thing really customizes your experience very well.

Not sure what the last update did but now I have a white background and can't see some writing because the font is in the same color as the background (or almost the same).
