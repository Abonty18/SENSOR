Andras Blake,"Fb keeps trying to add features, but they usually seem more annoying than helpful. In the meantime, more and more bugs keep popping up. For example, opening links in its internal browser now, making me have to open each one in my preferred browser, or suggesting posts from groups I am not in or people I don't know, instead of just showing me the people I choose to connect with. And the ads! About 1/3 of the scroll is ads anymore! What a joke.",1.0,2024-12-21
David Bean,"The latest update broke pinch to zoom on images and the standard Google swipe side to side gesture for ""back"". Now the back gesture works in some places of the app, but inexplicably you have to swipe up in others. And not being able to zoom at all on images on my phone is maddening. My close-up vision isn't great, so being able to zoom in on images is important. I'm hoping it's just bugged, and not intentionally removed.",2.0,2024-12-25
Chris,"This app is really unintuitive. Sometimes going to the same page from different places, you get different options for no reason I can figure out. FB seems to design the way groups work, to make it as difficult as possible to have an ongoing conversation out side of messenger. And now, notifications are in no logical order. FB puts the ones it thinks are important to the top. No option to have the newest to the top. I can't wrap my head around why?",2.0,2024-12-21
Meta Ze Gr8,"The app is lacking in features. With too many useless updates that bring absolutely no improvement in reliability nor speed. Is this the best Facebook can do?! ETA: If you thought the app couldn't get worse, think again. It randomly stops working for days on end. 2nd edit: newest update removes a feature on previous versions (clicking on the top of shared posts to take you to the OP).",1.0,2024-12-24
J S,"Would give zero stars if possible. I despise all that Facebook is and stands for, but that's besides the point. I only use Facebook for one thing: Marketplace. My biggest complaint at this time is that while browsing through my ""local"" listings, any time I back out of a listing it starts me ALL OVER FROM THE BEGINNING OF ""LOCAL"". This is EXTREMELY frustrating, but I will admit that it is a new issue that I've only begun experiencing today. Other than that, I wish Marketplace was a standalone app",1.0,2024-12-21
Geoff K,"12/11/24 With the last update, it consistently fails. It won't go to pressed tabs. Can't see notifications, messages or the like. When able to get to messages, can't reply to messages. Tried uninstalling w/ no luck. _______ This used to be a decent app. In the last few months, most images on profiles (even mine) show up as a black screen. I had the issue on my original phone, cleared the memory cache, but still had the issue. I got a replacement phone, and still have that problem. Please help!",1.0,2024-12-12
A Google user,"When I click like in the app, it no longer highlights so I don't know for sure if I've actually clicked it. And now when I click on a picture and try to go back, it goes back and forth between a big and small version of the picture. Hopefully the next update will fix it. Previous: Back button isn't working on certain areas. This whole @highlight thing is really annoying. What's up with that?

Dan Coyne,"""Never autoplay videos"" setting doesn't do anything. It ALWAYS autoplays the next video. ALWAYS. And the little button on screen to stop it from autoplaying is so tiny, that it's nearly impossible to press consistently. Facebook has been embracing ""hostile user interfaces"" of late.

Joe D,"Opening every single link in the internal Facebook browser for data-mining purposes is one of the dumbest and most annoying ""features"" they've added.

When you go and look at someone's page, it's setup differently. It would take you to where you'd see there main page. Now it goes directly to the ""photo"" tab.

My biggest complaint at this time is that while browsing through my ""local"" listings, any time I back out of a listing it starts me ALL OVER FROM THE BEGINNING OF ""LOCAL"".

Geoff K,"12/11/24 With the last update, it consistently fails. It won't go to pressed tabs. Can't see notifications, messages or the like. When able to get to messages, can't reply to messages. Tried uninstalling w/ no luck. _______ This used to be a decent app. In the last few months, most images on profiles (even mine) show up as a black screen. I had the issue on my original phone, cleared the memory cache, but still had the issue. I got a replacement phone, and still have that problem. Please help!",1.0,2024-12-12

And now when I click on a picture and try to go back, it goes back and forth between a big and small version of the picture. Hopefully the next update will fix it. Previous: Back button isn't working on certain areas. This whole @highlight thing is really annoying. What's up with that?

Dan Coyne,"""Never autoplay videos"" setting doesn't do anything. It ALWAYS autoplays the next video. ALWAYS. And the little button on screen to stop it from autoplaying is so tiny, that it's nearly impossible to press consistently. Facebook has been embracing ""hostile user interfaces"" of late. UPDATE: Not only is the button to stop autoplay tiny, but even when you do manage not hit it, it still autoplays anyway about half the time, and usually before the video you're actually watching is finished.",1.0,2024-12-09

David Bean,"The latest update broke pinch to zoom on images and the standard Google swipe side to side gesture for ""back"". Now the back gesture works in some places of the app, but inexplicably you have to swipe up in others. And not being able to zoom at all on images on my phone is maddening. My close-up vision isn't great, so being able to zoom in on images is important. I'm hoping it's just bugged, and not intentionally removed.",2.0,2024-12-25
Chris,"This app is really unintuitive. Sometimes going to the same page from different places, you get different options for no reason I can figure out. FB seems to design the way groups work, to make it as difficult as possible to have an ongoing conversation out side of messenger. And now, notifications are in no logical order. FB puts the ones it thinks are important to the top. No option to have the newest to the top. I can't wrap my head around why?",2.0,2024-12-21
