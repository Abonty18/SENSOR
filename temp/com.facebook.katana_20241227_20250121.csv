Jason,"Pixel 9 pro: if viewing a photo on a profile, the swipe back gesture doesn't work. The screen just flickers and nothing nothing happens. It's only in the Facebook app when viewing photos. Swipe works on all other apps. This is a Facebook app issue. It's happening to other pixel users. I am not able to use the back button at the top of the screen that shows up in the app. The top of the screen is greyed out. It's 2025 Facebook devs, base Android should have a working app!",1.0,2025-01-03
Richard Mathes,"Forced ads in the middle of a video or short isn't the way... super irritating and completely unacceptable to me. I spend 99% of my time watching videos if I'm on Facebook, and I will not be doing it anymore until forced ads are removed. I don't mind seeing them when I am scrolling through videos, but pausing a video to make me watch an ad is ridiculous.",1.0,2025-01-11
Alyssa Moore,"New post... its now 1/1/25 and I am here yet again because for the last week videos won't play in fb. They will play for a very short time and then the ""loading"" circle will appear and then ""there was a problem"" error message. Why does fb NEVER work! I tried uninstall ingredients. It didnt fix it. The last 3 days fb is completely glitchy. SLOW. Won't load anything correctly. I can't select the emotions on people posts, they are all grayed out. Why does this happen so often ðŸ˜•",2.0,2025-01-01
Will Marsh,"One of the most important app features (in my opinion) no longer works. I have ""Never Autoplay Videos"" set and videos are never supposed to start with sound, yet my app ignores these setting daily. Between that and an algorithm that increasingly prioritizes ads and weird influencer posts I couldn't care less about, Facebook is becoming worthless. Bold of these problems to keep increasing as Bluesky continues to grow.",1.0,2025-01-01
James M,Badly designed... The Facebook app has so much potential to be a good social media platform but every time I'm on Facebook the more and more I want to stay away from it. Videos lag. ALWAYS. No matter what it is it lags and it's very frustrating. Even turning video quality still lags. Ai shill everywhere. They promote the use of ai in their ads to their META space. Terrible bad ai generation. Censorship is another big issue killing social media platforms as a whole.,2.0,2024-12-30
Brandon Rouse,"The last two updates broke the pinch-to-zoom abilities on images & pictures on my phone. Being unable to zoom in on pictures is very frustrating. Especially if I have to take a screenshot to see a friend's picture more clearly. My vision isn't the greatest, so being able to zoom in on images is important. In fact, sometimes when you click on a picture it gets even smaller. Like it shrinks. Kinda like the pictures did if they were the wrong format in 2008. Please fix this issue, Thank you!!",1.0,2025-01-09
